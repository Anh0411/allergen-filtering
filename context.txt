Here's a focused and detailed step-by-step guide specifically for Phase 3 (Technical Design and Architecture), Phase 4 (Development), and Phase 5 (Testing and Validation) to clearly guide the completion of your Web-Based Allergen Recipe Filter Tool:

PHASE 3: TECHNICAL DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE

3.1 System Architecture Design

Action Items:
Clearly define and document system components:
Frontend (UI layer, user interactions)
Backend (business logic, data processing)
NLP processing pipeline (ingredient analysis, allergen detection)
Database (data storage schema)
Clearly document data flow between components (e.g., user queries → backend API → database queries → NLP pipeline → frontend).

Output:
Detailed architecture diagrams (UML diagrams, flowcharts).
Technical architecture documentation (Markdown/PDF).

3.2 Database Schema and Implementation

Action Items:
Review and finalize the provided database schema.
Implement the schema practically using a relational database (PostgreSQL recommended).
Clearly set up primary keys, foreign keys, and indexing for efficient query performance.

Output:
Implemented database with defined tables (recipes, ingredients, allergens, recipe_allergens, user_feedback).
ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) for documentation purposes.

3.3 NLP and Web-Scraping Pipeline Design

Action Items:
Document the full pipeline clearly:
Data extraction and scraping methods (BeautifulSoup, Selenium).
NLP processing steps (NER, tokenization, dependency parsing).
Allergen detection logic (explicit rule-based detection + NLP inference).
Define clear data formats at each pipeline stage (e.g., raw HTML → structured JSON → NLP annotated data).

Output:Pipeline architecture documentation.

Workflow diagrams showing data transformation and flow.


PHASE 4: DEVELOPMENT

4.1 Development Environment Setup

Action Items:
Install and configure:
Python environment (use Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm IDE).
Web scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium).
NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK).
Database connection tools (SQLAlchemy).
Frontend frameworks (ReactJS recommended).
Git/GitHub for version control.
Establish a virtual environment or Docker setup for consistent deployments.

Output:
Fully set up, documented development environment.
Clear setup instructions in project README.

4.2 Web-Scraping System Development

Action Items:
Develop robust scrapers for multiple culinary websites:
Handle dynamic content loading via headless browsers (Selenium).
Implement IP rotation and anti-blocking measures.
Store scraped data consistently (structured format).

Output:
Working scraping modules capable of scraping from at least five websites.
Clearly documented scraping rules and data structures.

4.3 NLP Model Development

Action Items:
Develop NLP pipeline:
Implement tokenization, named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing.
Create and integrate a comprehensive allergen dictionary (14 EU allergens).
Train NLP models:
Label a dataset manually (approx. 5,000 recipes, clearly annotated).
Train models (using spaCy) to identify allergens with >90% accuracy.
Integrate NLP inference with rule-based allergen checks.

Output:
NLP pipeline clearly detecting ingredients and allergens.
Trained NLP models and integrated hybrid allergen detection module.

4.4 Frontend Development

Action Items:
Develop responsive, user-friendly web interface:
Implement allergen filtering (checkboxes/toggles).
Implement recipe search (text-based and filters).
Display recipe details (ingredients, allergens, source link clearly highlighted).
Add feedback mechanism (user can submit errors/suggestions).

Output:
Complete, user-friendly web interface integrated with backend API.
Clear frontend documentation and codebase.


PHASE 5: TESTING AND VALIDATION

5.1 Functional Testing

Action Items:
Define test cases clearly based on user stories and acceptance criteria.
Execute functional tests systematically:
Scraping accuracy and completeness.
NLP allergen identification accuracy.
Frontend interactions (search, filters, feedback submission).

Output:
Functional test report clearly documenting test cases and results.

5.2 Performance and Accuracy Testing

Action Items:
Measure:
Query response time (< 2 seconds).
NLP allergen detection accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score against manual annotation).
Perform automated accuracy tests weekly for continuous monitoring.

Output:
Performance report clearly indicating system efficiency.
Weekly automated accuracy reports (clearly logged and documented).
